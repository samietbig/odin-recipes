    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>Egusi soup is native to West Africa (Nigeria), and many of my American and <br>
            Nigerian friends have enjoyed it. It is a great soup for those who like to try <br>
            something different every once in a while. Ground Egusi seeds give this soup a <br>
            unique color and flavor. If you can't find Egusi seeds, you can substitute <br>
            pumpkin seeds. Any combination of crab, shrimp, and smoked fish can be used <br>
            in place of the shrimp. Drained, smoked oysters and chicken can be used in place of the beef.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup pumpkin seeds</li>
            <li>1 ½ pounds cubed beef stew meat</li>
