    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>Rice dishes are very common in most West-African cultures and the Nigerian jollof rice is one of many great <br>
            variations. Jollof rice itself is popular in countries such as Ghana, Nigeria, and Senegal. Like I said in my food <br>
            in theory article Nigerian Jollof 101 â€“ Extras & Essentials, the debate on which country makes the best Jollof <br>
            is one that could go on forever. As a Nigerian, I can say that aside from the taste and flavour, a beautiful <br>
            thing about the Nigerian Jollof rice dish is how it varies. From the classic Jollof to party style Jollof and a <br>
            recent favourite that is basmati Jollof and more.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Chop the tomatoes, onions, and bell pepper into chunks. Place into a blender/food processor together with the ginger, garlic, and scotch bonnet pepper. Then blitz into a smooth paste.</li>
                <li>Place a pot over medium heat, pour in the sunflower oil, and add the blended mixture. Stir and allow to sizzle, then place a lid over it, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>After simmering for 20 minutes, remove the lid, then add the spices and seasonings (Paprika, thyme, nutmeg, bay leaf, and salt). Stir altogether.</li>
                <li>Also pour in the rice and vegetable or meat stock and stir together.</li>
                <li>Place a piece of aluminium foil into the pot, covering the entire surface of the rice (this will keep the steam in), then place a lid over the pot. Cook for 20 minutes on low heat (Stirring occasionally to cook the rice evenly and also to prevent it from burning at the bottom).</li>
                <li>Remove lid, bin the aluminium foil and give the rice a gentle stir, then return the lid and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Now the rice should be ready to serve. Serve hot with your favourite sides and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
